# CallingAnAPI

I made an API call to Dog CEOâ€™s Dog API which provides random images of dogs. I sent a GET request to the API endpoint 
and retrieved a JSON response containing the URL of a dog image which can be opened in a web browser to view the dog 
picture. A screenshot below shows the dog image URL output that was displayed after the code was run, along with the 
dog picture that was displayed after opening the URL in a web browser. 

Code URL Output:
